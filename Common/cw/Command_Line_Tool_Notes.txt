Metrowerks Command-Line Tools Release Notes
========================================================================


Version: Metrowerks CodeWarrior for Embedded PowerPC Release 4
Date:    30 November 1998
Author:  Ed Swartz, Command-Line Tools Engineer


========================================================================


To use the command-line tools, several environment variables must be
changed or defined.  This may be done in autoexec.bat in Windows 95/98
or in the Environment tab under the System control panel in Windows NT. 
In the following, "%CWFolder%" refers to the path where CodeWarrior for
EPPC R4 was installed.


Note that it is not necessary to include quote marks when defining
environment variables that include spaces.  Windows does not strip out
the quotes and this leads to "unknown directory" warnings.  Use the
following syntax if defining variables in batch files or at the command
line:


     set CWFolder=C:\Program Files\Metrowerks\CodeWarrior


------------------------------------------------------------------------


The PATH variable should include:


     %CWFolder%\Bin
     %CWFolder%\PowerPC_EABI_Tools\Command_Line_Tools
     
The first path contains the FlexLM license manager DLL, and the second
path contains the tools.


In order for FlexLM to work properly, you can simply copy the following
file into the directory from which you will be using the command line
tools:
	..\CodeWarrior\license.dat
	


Alternately, you can define the variable LM_LICENSE_FILE as:

     %CWFolder%\license.dat


This variable points to license information.  It may point to alternate
versions of this file, as needed.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Several environment variables are used at runtime to search for system
include paths and libraries which can shorten command lines for many
tasks.  All of the variables mentioned below are lists which are
separated by semicolons (';') in Windows and colons (':') in Solaris.


Unless '-nodefaults' is passed to on the command line, the compiler searches
for an environment variable called 'MWCEABIPPCIncludes' or 'MWCIncludes' (in
that order) which contains a list of system access paths to be searched
after the system access paths specified by the user.  The assembler also
does this, using the variables 'MWAsmEABIPPCIncludes' or 'MWAsmIncludes'.


Analogously, unless '-nodefaults' or '-disassemble' is given, the linker
will search the environment for a list of system access paths and system
library files to be added to the end of the search and link orders.  The
variable 'MWEABIPPCLibraries' or 'MWLibraries' contains a list of system
library paths to search for files, libraries, and command files.


Associated with this list is the variable 'MWEABIPPCLibraryFiles' or
'MWLibraryFiles' which contains a list of libraries (or object files or
command files) to add to the end of the link order.  These files may be
located in any of the cumulative access paths at runtime.


If you are only building for one target, it is okay to use 'MWCIncludes',
'MWAsmIncludes', 'MWLibraries', and 'MWLibraryFiles'.  The target-specific
versions of the variables come in handy when targeting multiple targets,
since the target-specific variables override the generic variables.  Note
that if the target-specific variable exists, the generic variable will not
be used; the contents of the two variables will not be combined.


------------------------------------------------------------------------


Files specified on the command line are identified by contents and file
extension, as in the IDE.  


The C/C++ compiler will accept non-standard file extensions as source
by default, without a warning.  The linker must be able to identify
all files as object code, libraries, or command files, or else they
will be ignored.


Linker command files must end in ".lcf".  They may be simply
added to the link line, for example:


     mwldeppc file.o lib.a commandfile.lcf
