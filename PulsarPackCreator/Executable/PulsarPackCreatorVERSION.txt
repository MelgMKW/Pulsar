Creator Changes:
-Build and Mass Import now use context menus for better accessibility.
-"Build Config Only" now builds the config without checking for files. The resulting file cannot be used in-game, but can be imported and modified in the software as needed.
-The previous "Build Config Only" behaviour is now executed by "Build Config & Tracks"
-Cup names and icons can now be imported without first having to import tracks.
-Building no longer deletes the already existing output folder if it fails.

Creator Changes:
-Fixed battle arenas not working for music slots in the mass import window.
-Fixed a crash on cups >100 when removing the name of the cup.

·Updated to 1.2.0
Creator Changes:
-Added a new tab to edit regular tracks experts. It is only visible if regs are enabled.
-Added a button to edit Pulsar BMGs directly. Note that you will need to edit these BMGs every time, since BMG ids could be removed, changed or added by any given update. For your own custom BMGs, taking MenuSingle_X.szs "common.bmg" file, editing it to your needs and putting it in UIAssets is a guaranteed permanent solution.
-Cup names and icons are no longer limited to 100. If you use more than 100 icons, the images resolution will gradually get reduced to preserve a small UIAssets.szs file.
-Now includes Wiimm tools dlls.
-No longer adds a space to every track on import.
-Now asks if the XML should be created on Build Config Only click.
-Now creates semi-unique (the mod name and a random 0-255 number) riivolution patch IDs on every build to prevent conflicts.

-Fixed text being allowed in various number-only boxes and leading to a crash.
-Fixed bad date imports when trying to import config files built on a different locale.
-Fixed bad CC distribution imports.
-Improved build and import code.
Engine Changes:
-Host always wins now provides a random button.
-Speedometer assets (in RaceAssets.szs) are now called PULSpeedo to prevent conflicts with CTGP's speedometer.
-COOB no longer activates on normal AREAs type 10.
-Fixed a crash that occured if you didn't select a track after selecting a cup online.
-Fixed an offline bug where a given SZS would get reused if it was on the same track slot as the previously played track.
-Fixed a badly ported NTSC-U address that was causing a crash when an item landed on the Maple Treeway bridge.
-Fixed infinite track randomizing issues.
-Lap splits are now displayed for up to 9 laps (credit to WingCapMan for the UI assets).
-Rear-view inputs no longer get stored into ghost files. Files that were already saved with rear-view inputs will unfortunately look backwards when replayed.

·Updated to 1.1.2
Creator Changes:
-Trying to build a pack of over 100 cups no longer throws an exception.

-Galaxy colosseum is now selectable as a music slots. Battle arenas are no longer selectable as track slots..
-The input/output folders no longer get created at the wrong location when the software is started through a .pul file.
-Attempt at making the mass import window work for everyone (the save buttons is somehow sometimes outside of the window and inaccessible), although this likely still does not address the issue.
-Fixed massive trophy counts getting written to config files.
Engine Changes:
-Cup Select buttons are no longer mistakenly unaccessible.
-If no controller input is made on the strap screen, boot to wiimmfi will be skipped (as it stands, no way to determine which controller the player is attempting to use).
-Flaps now work properly.
-RKG ghosts no longer get unproperly overwritten on load (currently, this causes slightly slower ghost loading times which is especially noticeable on console).
